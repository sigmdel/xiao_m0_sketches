/*
 * CorrectADCResponse.ino
 *
 * This sketch easily and quickly finds the right ADC correction values for SAM D21/D51 based boards.
 * The correction values that are found are only valid for the board where the sketch is executed.
 *
 * This example code is in the public domain.
 *
 * Written 6 May 2015 by Claudio Indellicati
 *
 * Modified to compile in the Arduino IDE and in PlatformIO.
 *
 * This is a stub to satisfy the Arduino IDE, the source code is in the file main.cpp in the
 * same directory.
 *
 * The library source file SAMD_AnalogCorrection.cpp was modified by SeeedStudio to handle
 * the SAM D51 microcontroller.
