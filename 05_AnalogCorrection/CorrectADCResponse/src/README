The Arduino IDE can find private libraries only if they are located in a directroy named `src` inside the directory containing the sketch's `.ino` file.

Here is an example directory structure of a sketch named `myapp.ino`  with two private libraries `Foo` and `Bar`. The sketch can be compiled in both the Arduino IDE and PlatformIO.

```
myapp_0_12
|
|- platformio.ini  // must contain
|
|--myapp
   |- main.cpp
   |- myapp.ino
   +--src
       |
       |--Bar
       |  |--docs
       |  |--examples
       |  +--src
       |     |- Bar.cpp
       |     |- Bar.h
       |     +- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc)
       |
       +--Foo
          |- Foo.cpp
          +- Foo.h
```

The libraries are included in the `src/main.cpp` file:

```
#include "src/Foo.h"
#include "src/Bar/src/Bar.h"
... 
```

The `platformio.ini` configuration file must contain the `src_dir` option.

```
[platformio]
; Make the Arduino IDE happy (.INO file must be in a directory of the same name)
src_dir = myapp
```
